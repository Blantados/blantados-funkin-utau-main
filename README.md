# All of Blantados' FNF MOD UTAUS!

Here are all the UTAU voicebanks I use for my videos! Feel free to use them for your own covers! Side Note: Some voicebanks don't work with certain resamplers. You have to download a few other resamplers, specifically fresamp, bkh01, and TIPS. Download links to those down below!

The main voicebanks by GenoX are not included here so you have to download them on his page!

# NOTICE:
Since some of you people are asking why some of the voicebanks won't work, it's probably because those were extra voicebanks I tend to use for like one sample or smthn. So if they don't work, if you have Audacity, just place the .wav files in Audacity and re-export them. Then they should work fine.

Please credit me if you end up using these voicebanks.
