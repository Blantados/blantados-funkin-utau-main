# Blantados' Cover Stuff

Here are all the UTAU voicebanks I use for my videos! Feel free to use them for your own covers! Side Note: Some voicebanks don't work with certain resamplers. You have to download a few other resamplers, specifically fresamp, bkh01, and TIPS. Download links to those down below! Now also includes a couple chromatic scales and a few MIDIs!

The main voicebanks by GenoX are not included here so you have to download them on his page!

# NOTICE:
Since some of you people are asking why some of the voicebanks won't work, it's probably because those were extra voicebanks I tend to use for like one sample or smthn. So if they don't work, if you have Audacity, just place the .wav files in Audacity and re-export them. Then they should work fine.

Please credit me if you end up using these voicebanks.
